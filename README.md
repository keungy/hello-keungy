# hello-keungy

Hi,Martians!

Keungy here! I like alien beings and languages.I travelled through some gates to get here.So many miles by foot!
I trust that I can master Martian language very soon.After that, we are surely to be good friends. 
By the way,if I knew there is no fire earlier, I would carry some sparks when I past by the sun.
